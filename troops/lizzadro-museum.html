    <p>
      Tour the Lizzadro Museum. The general tour includes an introductory presentation about earth science, focusing on the difference between rocks and minerals, how rocks form, fossils, and the rock cycle. Following the presentation, the Troops will have the opportunity to explore the Museum using a scavenger hunt as a tool to see the exhibits. This can take as short or long a time as you’d like. Typically, it takes kids 40-60 minutes to see the entire museum.
